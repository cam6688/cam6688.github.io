# college-portfolio
Home to literally everything I will make. Programming projects, art, graphic design, blog, youtube? Hey, if it's too much, at least you know I'm a pretty interesting and multifaceted person :D

(also, i haven't really touched github in ages and i don't remember how it works so this portfolio is a project in itself and i hope it will improve over time)
